In this Notebook I will answer the following questions:  Main Question:  Can we accurately predict temperature levels based on water features such as Salinity and Depth? How accurate, precise, or useful are these predictions?  Sub Questions: What is the relationship between Temperature and the following features: Salinity, Depth, Oxygen Mixing Ration and Pressure? Which features have a higher impact on Temperature than others? Supplementary Jupyter Notebook: “Bottle.ipynb”
